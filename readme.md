## Installation

unfortunately, there is no way to install the app on your phone to try it because Expo has disabled the ability to authenticate users using the ExpoGo app for security reasons

you can watch this video that shows the app at work  

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bWt9vHtml4g/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/bWt9vHtml4g)

or you can clone the repo and build it yourself 

```jsx
git clone https://github.com/technoo0/LSTN.git
touch .env 
npm install
npm start 
```

**note:**

These are the instructions for the app only you need to start the backend server also by following the instructions in the backend repo [HERE](https://github.com/technoo0/LSTN-Server)

## Usage

the app requires the user to log in/signup in one step then if the user is new to the app it asks them to fill in their data and then to connect their Spotify account after that the app finds the users that are close to you and shows you what song they are playing now

## Roadmap

- Add more Music apps other than Spotify
- integrate in-App massaging so users with the same music taste can connect with each other
- add notification system for when you get a like or when one of your likes if playing a new song
